# VBA-challenge
I was provided with data referring to tickers from the stock market that covered the years 2018-2020 for different companies. The data represented each company's increase or decrease throughout the year. 
I calculated the percentages for each ticker, identified the greatest increases and decreases in percentages, and the greatest increase in total volume out of every ticker provided. 
I coded so that red and green colors would highlight positive and negative values for the total changes that occurred for each given ticker over that given year.
